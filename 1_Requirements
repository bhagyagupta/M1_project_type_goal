To avoid the use of central server for all commmands, a local server will be loaded with the vaccine-registered data. Local verification and completion of vaccination data will be processed locally and will be loaded back to the main server by the end of day.The local server must store the data of around 100 people where the allocated online registration data will be loaded onto the local server of that local centre. Verification of the data is done based on the details provided by the patient. Once completed, the data of the vaccinated will be sent back for future use and reference.
